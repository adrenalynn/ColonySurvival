0.7.0.0 (2019-07-26)

This update will not be compatible with worlds loaded from before ( < 0.6.3), since there are too many big changes to properly convert a world.

- Added a new terrain generator with proper biomes and more landscape features
- Added an entirely new system for saving chunks and block data
- Added support for owning multiple colonies
- Added support for a colony having multiple owners (= co-op)
- Added support for hosting & playing on a LAN without an internet connection (suprisingly much work)
- Added a co-op menu to easily host worlds for co-op (worlds are seperate from singleplayer)
- Added support for remotely administrating a server using colonyserverrcon.exe
- Replaced/upgraded a <lot> of internal systems in order to fix various bugs, performance and code maintenance issues
- Noticably reduced network traffic required & reduced the cpu usage of networking
- Generally improved performance of both the client and server
- Improved mod support in preparation for steam workshop support; a lot of content based modding can be done through config files now
- Optimized loading so it should work quicker on slow hard drives
- Added basic trade deals between colonies
- Added basic science sharing agreements between colonies
- Added gliders as a form of transport

- Added the npcshop - npcs require to visit one every day to get their food & luxury items
- Added a whole heap of new items, jobs and science (see ingame for those)
- Added support for making "3D farms", to better deal with building on hills
- Added a happiness system (gives benefits for providing a nice variety of food and luxury items)
- Reworked a lot of icons to be much more visually pleasing
- Reworked a lot of blocks to be an actual object instead of a cube (like the bronze anvil - it's an anvil now)
- Removed the requirement for seeds from farmers

- Update Unity3D version from 5.6.5p3 to 2018.4.0f1
- Updated .NET runtime from 3.5 to 4.6

- A *lot* of other things, but the changelog has not really kept up with them. Apologies.
